# File manager with graphical user interface in Python
## 2021/22 summer semester, Computer Science WIEiT AGH UST

This repository contains project for Programming in Python Course. It is a simple file manager with GUI written in PyQT5 with basic functionality that one can expect from a file manager, but buggy and untested.

### How to setup:
- Make sure you have [Python 3 and pip](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed (at least 3.10)
- Clone this repository
- Optionally create and activate virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (and do everything else inside created environment)
- Install the package with
```bash
$ pip install path/to/repository
```
If you want to develop the project, use ```pip install -e```, which dynamically links project files instead of copying them.
